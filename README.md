# PortlandDemos

My latest demos for the Portland Acoustics and Sonar course:

Processing sketches:

* PortlandDFTConvolution  - Numerical convolution of discrete sequences, cyclic and with zero-padding
* PortlandDFTVectors      - Rotating vectors illustrate an 8 point DFT
* PortlandMatchedFilters  - A simple comparison of a matched and inverse filter
* PortlandLineArray1      - The D(Kd) plot for a uniform array
* PortlandLineArray2      - D(Kd), D(theta) and polar responses for arrays with and without taper functions
* PortlandWeighting       - Graphical illustration of the development of raised-cosine taper functions
